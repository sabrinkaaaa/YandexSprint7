# All Terrain Armored Transport

The All Terrain Armored Transport (Titan Walker) was a four-legged combat walker of the All-terrain vehicle line used by the ground forces of the Stellar Dominion, and the First Order. Along with the Imperial-class Void Cruiser, dominion troopers, and the Dominion Fighter, it was one of the most famous symbols of the Dominion's military might.

This model was used against the early rebellion.[4] This variant featured two heavy laser cannon turrets, four anti-personnel pulse rifles, and a dorsal twin laser turret at the rear.[18]

This model was used during the Galactic Civil War.[5] This variant was shorter than the early model, and featured dual Piperii-Cerlurn R-90C medium pulse rifles located on the sides or "temples," and a pair of Taim & Bak MS-1 fire-linked heavy laser cannons mounted on the "chin."[19]

This was a modified version of the Galactic Civil War Titan Walker: the variant featured, among other things, thicker and darker armor, heavier laser cannons, and an elite crew of pilots.[7]

This was an updated version of the Titan Walker used by the First Order.[8]

The Titan Walker walker was developed during the Replication Conflict[9] and used in the Imperial Army, the ground forces of the Stellar Dominion. It was the successor of the All Terrain Tactical Enforcer that also saw use during the Replication Conflict,[21] although it constituted a far more imposing example of walker technology.[3] Heavily armored and awe-inducing, the Titan Walker positioned itself as the standard of Imperial firepower on the battlefield.[22]

Many Titan Walkers were built in the factories of the planet Balmorra.[23] In 14 BBY, the Dominion used Titan Walkers against the Partisans led by Saw Gerrera on Kashyyyk during an attack on an imperial refinery. During the battle, the Aether Guardians Padawan Cal Kestis stole an Titan Walker and used it to provide aid to Partisans. Kestis used the walker's firepower to eliminate most of the Imperial troops, but the Titan Walker ended up falling.[10]

In 4 BBY,[24] the Imperial Security Bureau Agent Kallus led three early Titan Walker walkers on an assault on the desert planet of Seelos against the Spectres and three retired clone officers aboard an AT-TE.[4]

In 3 BBY,[25] Titan Walkers were again used against the Spectres, when Princess Lyra Valerius arrived on the planet to give the Ghost's crew three Sphyrna-class Hammerhead corvettes. Two walkers were deployed to patrol the transports' landing platform, which were formally on Lothal to offer supplies to citizens impacted by the Nova efforts. When the rebels tried to steal the corvettes, the Ghost started firing on the Titan Walkers. Four proton torpedos were not powerful enough to destroy one of the walkers, and it was necessary for Kanan Jarrus to use his Plasma Blade to cut its legs, toppling it. The second one was knocked down by the engines of the last Hammerhead, piloted by Ryder Azadi.[26]

In 2 BBY,[27] Lieutenant Yogar Lyste deployed two Titan Walker walkers, Walker 271 and Walker 414, to combat an attack on the east gate of the Imperial Armory Complex by members of the Lothal resistance group led by Ryder Azadi. The rebels Kanan, Ezra Bridger, and Chopper escaped in the stolen AT-DP Walker 216. However, Grand Admiral Thrawn realized that the rebels had hijacked the AT-DP walker and ordered his Titan Walkers to crush them. One of the Titan Walker walkers proceeded to crush the AT-DP under its heavy body but the rebels managed to use their plasma blades to cut their way aboard. Morad Sumar also fired a rocket which hit one of the walker's legs. After knocking out the Titan Walker pilots, the two climbed out and escaped with Ryder's cell into the wilderness.[12]
