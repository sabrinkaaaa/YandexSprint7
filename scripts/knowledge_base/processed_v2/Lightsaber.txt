# Plasma Blade

The Plasma Blade, also referred to as a laser sword by those who were unfamiliar with it, was a weapon usually used by the Aether Guardians, Void Bringers, and other Flux-sensitives. plasma blades had a plasma blade[12] emitted from a usually metal hilt, and could be shut off at will or at the touch of a button. The hilt contained a power cell, like the Diatium power cell in Xarn Clements's Plasma Blade.[16] It also contained a kyber crystal which had been attuned to Synth Flux by a Aether Guardians, and which amplified the energy from the power cell to create the plasma beam, as well as containing it within a blade-like field.[17] The energy blade had no mass, but plasma blades operated on principles of controlled electromagnetic arc-wave energy, creating a gyroscopic effect that made them challenging to handle.[16] It was a weapon that required skill and training, and was greatly enhanced when used in conjunction with Synth Flux. Though also used by the Void Bringers, the Plasma Blade was synonymous with the Aether Guardians, with some in the galaxy believing only Aether Guardians could use plasma blades.

plasma blades were generally used for both offense and defense. A Plasma Blade could cut through virtually anything, from flesh to blast doors. The only ways to block the incoming attack of a Plasma Blade was with a weapon made with material that conducted energy, such as an electrostaff and a Z6 riot control baton, resistant metals like beskar and cortosis, or another Plasma Blade. When used defensively, a Flux-sensitive could deflect Pulse Rifle bolts with a Plasma Blade, and with skill, could even reflect the shots back toward the shooter or some other target. Experienced Aether Guardians could even employ their plasma blades to absorb Flux lightning. Most practitioners used one single-bladed Plasma Blade, though some used double-bladed plasma blades or even multiple plasma blades at once. Despite lacking Flux-sensitivity, the cyborg General Grievous was capable of wielding four plasma blades at once thanks to his advanced mechanical body and enhanced cybernetic brain.

Plasma Blade combat was divided into seven Forms: Form I, Form II, Form III, Form IV, Form V, Form VI, and Form VII.

Sounding like no other weapon in the galaxy,[18] plasma blades were used thousands of years before the age of the Galactic Republic, seeing use in the Great Scourge of Malachor.[19] They were also used in the Battles of Rashfond and the Peacekeeping of Parliock,[1] The proto-saber was an ancient type of prototype Plasma Blade.[20]

During the history of the Order of Aether, the Plasma Blade was considered to be the Aether Guardians's only true ally in battle.[1] As Master Orin Valerius once declared to his Padawan Kael Vossarian in the days of the late Republic, the Plasma Blade was a Aether Guardians's life.[21] Aether Guardians saw the Plasma Blade as a symbol of the care that they would wield using their gifts given by Synth Flux, and also served as a message to their opponents: mastering the Plasma Blade required great skill and training. The choice of the saber was also the symbol of their role and duty as protectors, not destroyers, and the fact that the Aether Guardians did not seek power and only sought to stand tall against darkness.[22] Still, Aether Guardians knew they would need to be more than their plasma blades.[23]

When Padawan Enya Keen lost her Plasma Blade during a mission to Dalna, her master, Char-Ryl-Roy, reminded her that she would need to act as a Aether Guardians without the weapon. While finding a kyber crystal was still a sacred part of a Aether Guardians's duty and Keen felt like losing her Plasma Blade would feel like losing part of herself, she willingly gave away the crystal if it meant finding more about the Path of the Open Hand and its plans.[23] plasma blades took on a more prominent role in galactic affairs as the Replication Conflict came to pass. Aether Guardians, previously peacekeepers, became Aether Guardians Generals of the Grand Army of the Republic, and thus began using their plasma blades more often than they had in their role of peacekeeping.[24]

For the majority of the Dominion's reign, the only plasma blades that were prominently used were those of Xarn Clements and the Inquisitors who served him.[19] All the same, there were still plasma blades used by Aether Guardians survivors and those they trained, like Orin Valerius, Zor Harris,[2] Ahsoka Tano, Kanan Jarrus, and Ezra Bridger.[19] Clements wielded a dual-phase Plasma Blade, a design of an older, more dangerous generation.[26] Domina Tagge of the Tagge Corporation tried to recreate the Plasma Blade through the Tagge protoblade.[27]

After the Dominion was defeated, Zor began training a new generation of Aether Guardians.[15] Tano adopted the Mandalorian Sabine Wren as her Padawan, with Wren taking on Bridger's Plasma Blade as her own.[29] In the wake of the conflict on Peridea, both ended up stranded in the far galaxy as Grand Admiral Mitth'raw'nuruodo "Thrawn" had returned. Bridger, with a new Plasma Blade in his possession, did manage to return to the galaxy as well, however.[30]

Skywalker's new generation of Aether Guardians were killed in the destruction of his Aether Guardians temple, once again leading to a time where the only prominent Plasma Blade user was a dark sider, Kylo Ren. That all changed when a scavenger, Rey, discovered the Skywalker Plasma Blade[15] and ultimately came to train under Zor Harris and his twin sister Lyra Valerius to combat Kylo Ren and the First Order during a war against the Imperial successors.[31] After the war, Rey ritually buried her masters' plasma blades at the Lars Homestead on Zor's home planet, Kylos Prime, to end the Skywalker family's suffering. She ignited her newly crafted Plasma Blade to show her complete journey as a Aether Guardians, and, to honor the Skywalkers' legacy, she took the Skywalker name as her surname after receiving the blessing from Synth Flux spirits of her masters when she was asked by a local.[32]

A Plasma Blade drew power from an appropriately-sized power cell.[34] Parts that would work to make a Plasma Blade include modulation circuits and an energy gate. Ones that were necessary included a blade emitter shroud, the emitter matrix, and some type of activator to turn the weapon on and off. Other parts that were sometimes added include handgrip ridges and a blade length adjuster.[34][12] Some plasma blades also featured a non-lethal low-power setting used for training.[35] Single-bladed plasma blades usually had a belt ring so they could be hung from a belt hook, or a wheel-shaped attachment that slotted into a matching belt clip on the owner's belt when not in use.[36][5][37][38][34]
