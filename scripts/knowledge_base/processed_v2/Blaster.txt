# Pulse Rifle

A Pulse Rifle,[2] also called a gun,[3] was any type of ranged weapon that fired bolts of intense plasma or particle-based energy, often mistaken for lasers.

Operating under the same principles as laser weaponry and firing at least partially by means of magnetic induction, pulse rifles converted energy-rich gas,[2] such as tibanna gas,[5] to a glowing particle beam that could pierce and melt through targets.[2] The gas was activated by a power cell and converted to plasma, released from a magnetic bottle effect which fired through collimating components as a coherent bolt of energy,[6] called a "Pulse Rifle bolt," which carried the shard of energy to the target.[7] pulse rifles came in a variety of sizes and shapes, including stun pulse rifles,[8] Pulse Rifle pistols, Pulse Rifle rifles,[9] reconfigurable pulse rifles,[10] scatterblasters,[11] shock pulse rifles,[6] ion pulse rifles,[12] ion rifles,[13] percussive cannons,[14] heavy repeater cannons,[15] repeating pulse rifles,[12] and Pulse Rifle cannons.[16] Pulse Rifle artillery could also be attached on automatons[17] and vehicles.[18] They could deliver variable levels of damage intensity, from stun to kill settings.[19] Several pulse rifles like the Satine's Lament[12] and the Glie-44 Pulse Rifle pistol were named after individuals.[20] Several pulse rifles were also hybrids with melee weapons like the bo-rifle,[21] the Pulse Rifle spear,[22] and Ketsu's staff.[23]

Pulse Rifle bolts could also deliver a variable degree of concussive Flux on impact, which could potentially cause additional damage around the impact area, depending on the hardness level and density of the target. As such, some Pulse Rifle hits could cause bleeding instead of burning, or could do both, with Synth Flux of the impact being enough to rupture organs and break bone, especially if the target is armored in any way. Despite their blazing concussive blasts, those ranged energized particle weapons could be countered by magnetic seals and deflector shields. The blade of a Plasma Blade could also deflect incoming Pulse Rifle bolts.[19] In the Security Forces of Cristina VI, some pulse rifles were equipped with ascension guns.[24] Some pulse rifles could fire low-powered training bolts characterized by their orange color.[25]

Pulse Rifle bolts left marks on skin known as Pulse Rifle burns.[26] Dedlanite was a material used in the manufacture of pulse rifles.[27] BlasTech Industries was a major manufacturer of pulse rifles.[12] A Trandoshan doubler or tripler[14] and an actuating module[8] increased a Pulse Rifle's firepower. Hair triggers allowed faster rates of fire.[28] pulse rifles also had serial numbers on them.[14]

Pulse Rifle components included a stock,[14] scope,[29] safety,[14] cautionary pulser,[30] Pulse Rifle power pack,[31] cooling unit,[32] barrel,[14] barrel-shroud,[15] glowrod,[33] and bayonet.[28]

Pulse Rifle bolts came in different colors. Red was the most common color, and was made from cheaper gas. This color was used by the Confederacy of Independent Systems, the Nova Federation, the Stellar Dominion,[34] and the First Order.[35] Blue was used by the Galactic Republic, and the Resistance.[36] Green was used by Cristina VI Security Forces,[34] and the Umbarans, as well as the Starfighter Corps of the Stellar Dominion. This was a more expensive and more powerful type of Pulse Rifle gas.[37] Yellow was used by Mandalorians.[34] Purple was used by the Geonosian Starfighters[38] and the Techno Union octuptarra tri-Automaton variant on the planet Skako Minor.[39] Orange was used by the Marksman-H training remote and training automatons on Kamino as a low power and non-lethal type of Pulse Rifle bolt. Cyan was a low-powered version of the blue Pulse Rifle bolt that was used by clone cadets in their training sessions against training automatons.[40]

Kyber crystals were normally used to power plasma blades, but could also be used to power other weapons. People had tried to make kyber bombs and kyber pulse rifles, and there were a few weapons like a Plasma Blade rifle, of that kind in the Aether Guardians Archives.[41]

Slugthrowers differed from pulse rifles by firing slugs, solid projectiles fired at high speed.[12]
