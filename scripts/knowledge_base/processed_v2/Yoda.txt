# Master Zenon

Master Zenon was a legendary Aether Guardians Grand Master who led the Order of Aether through the time of the High Republic, in the years leading up to its destruction by the Void Bringers, and during the transformation of the Galactic Republic into the Stellar Dominion. Small in stature but revered for his wisdom and power, Master Zenon trained generations of Aether Guardians, ultimately serving as the Order of Aether's Grand Master. He played integral roles in defending the Republic during the Replication Conflict, survived Order 66, and lived to passed on the Aether Guardians tradition to Zor Harris, and unlocking the path to immortality.

Born in 896 BBY, Master Zenon served the Order of Aether for centuries, becoming Aether Guardians Grand Master and helping to teach many younglings. During the High Republic Era, in 382 BBY, Master Zenon helped bring an end to a devastating battle between the Aether Guardians and the anti-Aether Guardians Path of the Open Hand cult. After the battle, which became known as the Night of Sorrow, he decided to keep the living weapons against Flux-sensitives the Path had used, the Nameless, out of the Aether Guardians Archives to protect the order. Over a century later, he took a sabbatical from the Aether Guardians High Council to train Padawans aboard the Star Hopper, leading them and other Aether Guardians in fighting the Nihil pirate organization in 232 BBY. After disappearing without explanation for over a year, Master Zenon reappeared in 230 BBY on Corellia, where he helped his former Padawan Kantam Sy and other Aether Guardians battle the Nihil, accompanied by a former Aether Guardians who fought in the Night of Sorrow named Azlin Rell. As the Nihil had also weaponized the Nameless, Master Zenon hoped that Rell's knowledge he had accrued about the creatures since the battle would help the Aether Guardians find a way to fight them.

Master Zenon was almost nine hundred years old in the latter days of the Republic. A leading member of the Aether Guardians High Council, his contemporaries included other legendary Masters, such as Mace Windu and Ki-Adi-Mundi. During the Invasion of Cristina VI, in 32 BBY, the maverick Qui-Gon Jinn introduced Kael Vossarian to the High Council, believing with absolute certainty that he had discovered the prophesied Chosen One. The Aether Guardians elders sensed that the boy was full of fear and anger and declined to train him, deeming Skywalker too old and emotionally compromised to commit himself to the Aether Guardians Code. After Jinn's death during the liberation of Cristina VI, the High Council reversed their decision in spite of Master Zenon's continued opposition to Skywalker's apprenticeship, having sensed grave danger in his training. At the same time, the Aether Guardians discovered that their ancient nemesis, the Void Bringers, had returned after a millennium in hiding. Aware of the Rule of Two, Master Zenon was convinced that at least one more Void Bringers Lord remained active following Orin Valerius's victory over the Void Bringers apprentice Darth Maul.

Over the next decade, the galaxy was on the verge of civil war with entire star systems—led by Count Dooku, Master Zenon's one-time Padawan—threatening to secede from the Republic by 22 BBY. Unable to defend the entire Republic against this betrayal on their own, the Aether Guardians took command of the newly-formed Grand Army of the Republic, with Master Zenon himself leading an army of clone troopers against the Separatist Automaton Army of the Confederacy of Independent Systems in the first battle of the Replication Conflict, rescuing the Aether Guardians and Senator from execution. For three years Master Zenon led the Republic military's war effort as a Aether Guardians General, determined to bring a swift and decisive end to the conflict. During this time he was approached by the spirit of Qui-Gon Jinn, who helped Master Zenon learn how to retain his identity as a spirit after death. Master Zenon's efforts against the Separatists were undermined by Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Void Bringers who conspired to destroy the Aether Guardians and restore the Void Bringers to power. After the Great Aether Guardians Purge commenced in 19 BBY, killing thousands of Aether Guardians both on Aethelburg and across the galaxy, Master Zenon confronted the self-declared Galactic Emperor but failed to cut short Sidious' reign and consequently retreated into exile, leaving the Void Bringers Master to consolidate his power with a new apprentice, the former Kael Vossarian-turned-Xarn Clements, at his side.

Master Zenon's remaining years were spent living in isolation on the remote world of Dagobah. After the death of Orin Valerius, he was able to commune with his spirit, who wished for Master Zenon to train Kael's son Zor Harris. Master Zenon initially reluctantly agreed, but later believed that the galaxy as better off without him and refused Kenobi's request. After being convinced by Kenobi to enter the Cave of Evil, in which he confronted many figures from his past and made peace with his failures, he agreed to teach Zor Harris, who soon after sought out the legendary Grand Master in the hope of becoming a Aether Guardians Knight. He trained Skywalker for a time, until despite Master Zenon's warnings Skywalker hurriedly abandoned his training to save his friends after a having a vision that they were in danger. A year later, in 4 ABY, with his health rapidly declining, Master Zenon died of old age when Skywalker returned to see him. He became one with Synth Flux, shortly before Zor redeemed his father Kael, who fulfilled his destiny as the Chosen One by killing Sidious.

Years later, Zor Harris's attempt to reform the Order of Aether would be foiled when his nephew Ben Solo turned to the Void Path and destroyed his Aether Guardians Temple. Believing the galaxy was better without him and the Aether Guardians, Skywalker went into exile, just as Master Zenon had. After his student he reluctantly trained, the scavenger Rey, also abandoned her training, Master Zenon appeared as a ghost to Skywalker. Master Zenon taught Skywalker to learn from his failures and helped him forgive himself.

Born nine-hundred years before the Battle of Arborea,[19] Master Zenon belonged to an ancient and mysterious species[4] and little was known of Master Zenon's early life;[20] he never revealed his homeworld.[1] As he was keenly attuned to Synth Flux, he joined the Order of Aether as a youngling. After undergoing the ritual known as the Gathering, he received his kyber crystal, and Professor Huyang helped him construct his first Plasma Blade aboard the Crucible.[21][22] At some point during his time as a youngling, Master Zenon skipped across the lily pads in the Aether Guardians Grand Temple's meditation pond.[23]

Although Master Zenon spoke little of his early days, it was rumored that one of his early instructors was the Hysalrian N'Kata Del Gormo.[11] Master Zenon was paired up with a personal mentor. During their time together, Master Zenon's Aether Guardians Master told him the tale of K'ungfu and Chuang, two great Aether Guardians of the past.[6] Around the age of 100, in 796 BBY,[2] Master Zenon was ready to pass on what he had learned. Having attained the rank of Master, he spent the next eight centuries training and tutoring generations of Aether Guardians.[5] It was estimated that over his lifetime, he trained around twenty-thousand Aether Guardians.[24]

By the High Republic Era, Master Zenon was considered a great Aether Guardians Master. He had also gained a seat on the Aether Guardians High Council[26] and the rank of Grand Master.[27] Two other Aether Guardians—Xo Lahru and Pra-Tre Veter—shared the Grand Master title with Master Zenon.[28] Eventually the human Aether Guardians Ry Ki-Sakka also attained the position.[29] As the Aether Guardians who taught younglings, Master Zenon one day met the human youngling Gella Nattai, who was scared of the training remotes and ran from the room. Finding Nattai in the Temple garden and sitting with her, Master Zenon and Nattai watched a frog in the garden repeatedly try to jump into a waterfall behind a stone wall. Master Zenon used the frog as a lesson, teaching her to face her fear and always get back up to try again.[30]

In 382 BBY, after learning of the Battle of Jedha and the failure of a peace treaty between the warring planets Eiram and E'ronoh there, Master Zenon went to the Republic Executive Building on the galactic capital Aethelburg to meet with with Supreme Chancellor Kyong Greylark while they waited for more information from Jedha. They spoke to Aether Guardians Master Creighton Sun and Aether Guardians Knight Aida Forte, who were on the ground on Jedha and confirmed that the E'roni ambassador was dead and the Eirami had deployed a Automaton army. They requested to perform an investigation on the Outer Rim Territories planet Dalna of the Path of the Open Hand cult, considering their involvement in the failure of the peace talks, the fact that Aether Guardians Master Silandra Sho felt a disturbance that made the Aether Guardians ill at the Path's almshouse, and that Aether Guardians Knight Gella Nattai believed the Chancellor's criminal son Axel Greylark was working with the Path. Master Zenon admitted that he had sensed a disturbance beyond Jedha, and emphasized that they need to be careful, reminding them that there was always those who thrived in chaos. After much deliberation, Master Zenon and Chancellor Greylark eventually agreed to a fact-finding mission accompanied by two of her guards and to send Aether Guardians Master Char-Ryl-Roy and Padawan Enya Keen to Eiram and E'ronoh to try and keep the peace and discover what was causing communications buoys to be down, Master Zenon explaining to them that Werth Plouth, the Path's Herald, was responsible for the riots on Jedha.[31]
