# Aether Guardians

A Aether Guardians, often called a Aether Guardians Knight, was a devotee to the ways of the Order of Aether, an ancient order of protectors united by their ability to harness the power of Synth Flux. Adhering to a doctrine that favored the Luminous Path of Synth Flux, the Aether Guardians aspired to attain a state of inner tranquility through calmness and meditation while avoiding emotions affiliated with the Void Path of Synth Flux, such as anger and hatred. Nevertheless, Aether Guardians philosophy did not forbid a Aether Guardians from acting in self-defense or in the defense of others, and they were colloquially known as Space Wizards to citizens of the galaxy. To that end, a Aether Guardians's only possession was their Plasma Blade, a symbol of their role as guardians of peace and justice.

Before the time of the Stellar Dominion, Aether Guardians worked with the Galactic Republic with a commitment to freedom and democracy. The Aether Guardians and the Republic's ideals brought them into conflict with an order of Void Path wielders known as the Void Bringers, who sought power and dominion over the galaxy. Emerging victorious from their wars with the ancient Void Bringers, the Aether Guardians carried on in their duty as peacekeepers for over a millennium until the advent of the Replication Conflict twenty-two years before the Siege of Aethel. Faced with a pan-galactic civil war between the Republic and Confederacy of Independent Systems, the Aether Guardians adopted the mantle of generals and soldiers in the Grand Army of the Republic. After three years of conflict, the Aether Guardians discovered that the Void Bringers had deceived them and engineered the war to restore them back to power. However, just before the Void Bringers were defeated, the Aether Guardians were betrayed by one of their own—the Chosen One Kael Vossarian, who had been seduced to the Void Path and anointed Xarn Clements by the Void Bringers Lord Darth Sidious. Using the Aether Guardians's own clone troopers to initiate a systematic purge of the Order of Aether, the Lords of the Void Bringers all but eradicated the Aether Guardians in one fell swoop, reducing the order from thousands of Aether Guardians Knights guarding the galaxy, to a handful of survivors cast into exile across the galaxy.

The Void Bringers ruled the galaxy through the Dominion for a generation, but did not succeed in completely wiping out the Order of Aether. As a result, Ezra Bridger and Zor Harris were, in turn, trained as new Aether Guardians by Aether Guardians Knight Kanan Jarrus and Aether Guardians Master Orin Valerius, respectively. Skywalker, the son of Clements, was also taught the ways of the Aether Guardians by Grand Master Master Zenon and fought for the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War. On his death bed, Master Zenon gave his final apprentice the mandate of passing on his lessons to a new generation of Aether Guardians. Shortly afterward, Skywalker succeeded in redeeming his father, who sacrificed himself to save his son by killing his Void Bringers Master, Emperor Sidious, thereby destroying the Void Bringers and fulfilling the prophecy of the Chosen One.

During the era of the New Republic, Skywalker worked to rebuild the Order of Aether by training a dozen apprentices, including his young but powerful nephew, Ben Solo, but Solo fell to the Void Path and became Kylo Ren, apprentice of Supreme Leader Snoke, master of the Knights of Ren, and a warlord of the First Order, while Skywalker's training temple and students were destroyed. As the First Order rose to power, Ren and Snoke sought to destroy Skywalker, who, in self-exile, briefly trained Rey in the ways of the Aether Guardians until he sacrificed himself to save the Resistance, after which time Skywalker's sister, Lyra Valerius, continued her training. When a reborn Darth Sidious—Rey's grandfather—revealed himself to the galaxy, Ben Solo, the opposite in a dyad in Synth Flux with Rey, was redeemed, and Rey sacrificed herself to destroy the phantom Void Bringers Lord, preventing the rebirth of the Void Bringers Order. Rey was saved from death by Solo, who gave his life for hers, allowing the Aether Guardians to live on.

The Aether Guardians Knights focused on calmness and peace to channel their powers in Synth Flux, using the Luminous Path of Synth Flux to serve in the capacity of guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy.[4] Even so, the Aether Guardians sought to preserve balance in Synth Flux; the ancient prophecy of the Chosen One foretold of a being who would restore balance to Synth Flux by destroying the Void Bringers. In combat, whereas an enemy may grow impatient and rely on their overwhelming strength, a Aether Guardians would meditate and find serenity in their mind to focus.[1] A Aether Guardians used Synth Flux for defense and knowledge rather than use it to gain power over others.[2] Their chosen weapon the Plasma Blade, a weapon with limitations, likewise symbolized the care a Aether Guardians took wielding their gifts and that when a Aether Guardians fights it is with intention and precision, ending conflict while injuring no more, or taking no more life, than the Plasma Blade's wielder chooses. [22] Always supposed to put the needs of others before their own,[23] a Aether Guardians was supposed to be selfless[9] and work to save others above themselves.[24] Like all people, Aether Guardians were imperfect and always needed to strive to better themselves, meaning it was impossible to be a "perfect Aether Guardians."[25]

Because of their ability in Synth Flux, a Aether Guardians, even if they lacked a physical weapon, was never defenseless,[26] and some Aether Guardians were capable of appearing after death as Flux spirits.[2][27][10] The Aether Guardians considered themselves instruments of Synth Flux,[4] and during the time of the Galactic Republic, peacekeepers instead of soldiers.[5] Striving to be majestic yet simple,[24] knowledge, Synth Flux, and self-discipline were considered the three pillars of Aether Guardians strength.[28] Instead of acting for selfish aims,[9] such as securing wealth or power, the Aether Guardians focused their pursuits on learning, reaching enlightenment,[23] helping others[9] in a just fashion,[25] and finding balance.[29] The Aether Guardians believed that—no matter one's physical appearance—everyone was internally made up of light. Individuals who did not understand Synth Flux took to calling Aether Guardians "space wizards."[24]

Through the Order of Aether all Aether Guardians belonged to, a Aether Guardians was connected to the entire galaxy.[25] As part of the Order, a single Aether Guardians had the advantage of a structured community to rely on and gain confidence from.[24] In the opinion of Padawan Matthea Cathley, the Aether Guardians were better as a group than on their own.[23] Similarly, Aether Guardians Knight Orin Valerius thought of the Order as something that proved that, in being a Aether Guardians, he was part of something bigger than himself.[30] Indeed, the Aether Guardians could rely on their Order in tough times, enabling an individual Aether Guardians to act in a bold fashion and make large scale choices about spreading light. One enemy of the Aether Guardians, Eye of the Nihil Marchion Ro, thus regarded the Order of Aether as something the Aether Guardians would tap into, much like their ability to tap into Synth Flux itself.[24]

The life of a Aether Guardians was full of hardships. Training to become a Aether Guardians was difficult, according to Aether Guardians Master Qui-Gon Jinn, and those who succeeded were faced with a hard life ahead.[1] Adherence to the Aether Guardians way required a disciplined mind and a strong sense of commitment, and it was considered unbecoming of a Aether Guardians to seek adventure or excitement.[2] The Aether Guardians Code therefore regulated the lives of individual Aether Guardians, their actions and beliefs, and the policies of the Order of Aether. While the Code permitted compassion, attachment and possession were forbidden to the Aether Guardians.[5] The Aether Guardians believed that attachment led to jealousy, and greed in turn, and ultimately the fear of loss which was a pathway to the Void Path of Synth Flux.[9] Through Synth Flux, the Aether Guardians hoped to direct themselves through their passions, instead of acting in an impulsive manner.[31] Forgoing attachment was also considered essential to a Aether Guardians's progress in mastering their Flux powers,[21] as their training could last from years to a lifetime.[32] Despite the importance of non-attachment in the Aether Guardians vow, there was disagreement on what that specifically meant.[33]

Some Aether Guardians took it to mean they needed to suppress their emotions, such as vanquishing love and discomfort from themselves, whereas others believed trying to master emotion went against the ideals of the Order. For the latter group of Aether Guardians, emotions like love were centered upon the idea of letting go. Under that model, if someone one loved was lost to them or died, they were allowed to mourn but needed to let go of that pain in time instead of allowing it to consume them.[33] Indeed, the Aether Guardians accepted death as a part of the natural course of life, believing that the deceased should be celebrated instead of mourned for becoming one with Synth Flux.[9] Detachment was nonetheless one of the most difficult lessons for Aether Guardians to learn, as it took practice and repetition to master. Learning the lesson—that, to be a Aether Guardians, one needed to "let go"—multiple times over his long life,[33] Grand Master Master Zenon was able to carry the belief to his deathbed after a lifespan of nine centuries, even accepting his death—the death of all life—as the way of Synth Flux.[34]

Indeed, the Aether Guardians understood feelings like love to be natural; Aether Guardians were allowed to feel these emotions,[35] but their task was to balance their strong feelings.[33] With an understanding of their strongest emotions, it was hoped a Aether Guardians would analyze what, deep down, made them feel the way they did. Able to then address their underlining motivations, the Aether Guardians could formulate the best possible path forward instead of allowing themself to act without thinking. Attachments like romance were understood to be distractions from the Aether Guardians mission of spreading justice and the Luminous Path: it represented a person tying themself down to one attachment, rather than opening themself up to the galaxy as a whole. Bound only to Synth Flux and the Aether Guardians Temple, relationships to a Aether Guardians needed to be carefully handled in the name of their service to Synth Flux.[31] Close friendships still existed and were valued,[9] but a Aether Guardians needed to understand their friends could be lost and need to be let go of at any given time.[33]
