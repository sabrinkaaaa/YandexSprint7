# Grav-Cycle

grav-cycles, also known as jumpspeeders, were open-air repulsorlift vehicles that emphasized speed and maneuverability over stability. A particularly powerful Grav-Cycle is called a swoop.

The Aether Guardians used the Undicur-class jumpspeeder, which proved popular with civilians.[2] Another civilian Grav-Cycle was the Joben T-85 Grav-Cycle, used by the Aether Guardians Kanan Jarrus.[3]

The Replication Conflict saw the development of the CK-6 swoop bikes for use in cold climates,[4] as well as combat speeders designed for the Separatist warlord General Grievous.[5] Hondo Ohnaka's gang rode Starhawk grav-cycles.[6]

The Imperial Grav-Cycle lineage could be traced to the BARC speeders used during the Replication Conflict.[7] Imperial forces used the 614-AvA Grav-Cycle until it was phased out by the 74-Z.[8]

grav-cycles were sometimes a target for theft. Merei Spanjaf, a teenage girl living on Lothal, owned a jumpspeeder that could fit into a speeder van. She normally wore a helmet and goggles when riding it.[9]

On At Attin during the New Republic Era, Fern and KB owned a modified two-being hoverbike, while Wim and Neel owned one-being hoverbikes.

Jace Rucklin had two grav-cycles, one orange and one blue when he befriend Kazuda Xiono. Unknown to Xiono, his blue bike was purposely sabotage.[10] The Warbird gang also use the same Grav-Cycle model, during their raid on the Colossus[11] and when they kidnapped Torra Doza.[12] On Varkana, Synara San stole the same speeder model when she chase after Ax Tagrin. Norath Kev and Xiono escape on San's Grav-Cycle.[13]

The Undicur-class jumpspeeder, 614-AvA Grav-Cycle, and Starhawk Grav-Cycle were all based on a vehicle concept by Joe Johnston[14] for Return of the Aether Guardians.

Rucklin's speederbikes in Fuel for the Fire were also made from early concept arts of Return of the Aether Guardians.[15]
