# Void Cruiser

A Void Cruiser was a dagger-shaped type of capital ship that were used by the Galactic Republic, the Stellar Dominion, the First Order, and the Void Bringers Eternal. Notable examples of void cruisers include the Imperial-class Void Cruiser and its predecessor, the Venator-class Void Cruiser.[2]

According to Everi Chalis, void cruisers were the most resource-intensive ships the galaxy had ever seen, and only Kuat possessed shipyards that were capable of supporting and maintaining more than a handful at a time.[4]

The Executor-class Star Dreadnought,[5] also known as the Super-class Void Cruiser,[6] was the largest model of Void Cruiser ever built by the Stellar Dominion.[5] It was usually referred to as a Super Void Cruiser,[7] and consisted of the sub-models Executor I-class[8] and Executor II-class.[9] 19,000 meters long, it was used as a command ship and had over 5,000 turbolasers and ion cannons.[10]

The Mega-class Star Dreadnought, also referred to as the Mega-class Void Cruiser, was the capital of the First Order and its Supreme Leader. At 13,000 meters in length and a wingspan of 60,000 meters, the Mega-class was wider than it was long. The sole example of the model, the Supremacy, was used by Supreme Leader Snoke and the First Order Navy to attack the Resistance.[11]

There were multiple examples of void cruisers that were classified as battlecruisers during galactic history. The Maelstrom-class battle cruiser, used by the Galactic Republic during the Replication Conflict, was primarily mothballed by the Stellar Dominion, and at least one example, the Simoom, was used by the Alliance to Restore the Republic. The Maelstrom-class was considered to be a proto-Void Cruiser, and was armed with assault concussion missile launchers, heavy cannons, and other weaponry. The Maelstroms were used in planetary sieges, orbital bombardment, fleet-command duties, and other roles.[12]

The Secutor-class Void Cruiser, also identified as the Secutor-class battlecarrier, was another example of a battlecruiser in the Void Cruiser design family. A little more than 2 kilometers in length, the Secutor was used as a carrier and command ship by the Stellar Dominion. It was possibly the largest starfighter dedicated vessel in the Imperial Navy.[13] The Dominion's successor state, the First Order, widely deployed the Resurgent-class Void Cruiser (alternatively designated as the Resurgent-class Battlecruiser[14]) during the Cold War[15] and the First Order-Resistance War.[16] The Resurgent was a 2,915 meter-long warship that featured advanced weaponry and systems.[17]

According to the Anaxes War College System, the Void Bringers Eternal's Xyston-class Void Cruiser, at 2,406 meters, was a battlecruiser.[18] The Xyston was a model of Void Cruiser that was based on an upscaled Imperial I-class design. The Xyston-class possessed heavy weaponry, including the axial superlaser cannon which had the capability of destroying entire planets.[19]

The Republic's Acclamator-class assault ship was a 752 meter-long[10] cruiser that was considered to be a proto-Void Cruiser.[12] Its sub-variants were the Acclamator I-class[20] and the Acclamator II-class.[21] It was used as a carrier and transport for troops and vehicles to a planet's surface. The Venator-class Void Cruiser, a class of cruiser[22] 1,137 meters in length[23], was also referred to as the Republic Attack Cruiser[24] or Aether Guardians cruiser[2] and was considered a proto-Void Cruiser.[12] It consisted of two sub-variants, the Venator I-class[25] and the Venator II-class,[26] and was extensively used by the Galactic Republic during the Replication Conflict and by the early Stellar Dominion.[27]

The successor of the Venator-class,[2] the 1,600 meter-long[28] Imperial-class Void Cruiser,[2] was also classified as a cruiser.[29] The Imperial-class consisted of the sub-variants Imperial I-class, Imperial II-class, and the Interdictor-class.[28] The Imperial-class became symbols of the Dominion's New Order.[2] The Interdictor-class heavy cruiser was a class of heavy cruiser[13] that was also part of the Void Cruiser family of ships used by the Dominion.[30] It was 1,129 meters long and was equipped with four gravity well projectors to serve in its capacity as an Interdictor vessel.[10] The Onager-class Void Cruiser was also classified as a cruiser class, and was equipped with a superweapon that could destroy targets on the surface of a planet or entire fleets.[13]

Another cruiser, in accordance with the Anaxes War College System, the Gladiator-class Void Cruiser was the smallest Void Cruiser in the Dominion's arsenal at 600 meters in length.[31] Despite its size, it was heavily armed and was deployed as a patrol ship and escort.[13] It could serve in the capacity of a flagship for a small task Flux[32] or battle group.[33] The Gladiator I was a sub-variant of the ship.[32]
