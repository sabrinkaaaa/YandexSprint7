# Lightsaber

The lightsaber, also referred to as a laser sword by those who were unfamiliar with it, was a weapon usually used by the Jedi, Sith, and other Force-sensitives. Lightsabers had a plasma blade[12] emitted from a usually metal hilt, and could be shut off at will or at the touch of a button. The hilt contained a power cell, like the Diatium power cell in Darth Vader's lightsaber.[16] It also contained a kyber crystal which had been attuned to the Force by a Jedi, and which amplified the energy from the power cell to create the plasma beam, as well as containing it within a blade-like field.[17] The energy blade had no mass, but lightsabers operated on principles of controlled electromagnetic arc-wave energy, creating a gyroscopic effect that made them challenging to handle.[16] It was a weapon that required skill and training, and was greatly enhanced when used in conjunction with the Force. Though also used by the Sith, the lightsaber was synonymous with the Jedi, with some in the galaxy believing only Jedi could use lightsabers.

Lightsabers were generally used for both offense and defense. A lightsaber could cut through virtually anything, from flesh to blast doors. The only ways to block the incoming attack of a lightsaber was with a weapon made with material that conducted energy, such as an electrostaff and a Z6 riot control baton, resistant metals like beskar and cortosis, or another lightsaber. When used defensively, a Force-sensitive could deflect blaster bolts with a lightsaber, and with skill, could even reflect the shots back toward the shooter or some other target. Experienced Jedi could even employ their lightsabers to absorb Force lightning. Most practitioners used one single-bladed lightsaber, though some used double-bladed lightsabers or even multiple lightsabers at once. Despite lacking Force-sensitivity, the cyborg General Grievous was capable of wielding four lightsabers at once thanks to his advanced mechanical body and enhanced cybernetic brain.

Lightsaber combat was divided into seven Forms: Form I, Form II, Form III, Form IV, Form V, Form VI, and Form VII.

Sounding like no other weapon in the galaxy,[18] lightsabers were used thousands of years before the age of the Galactic Republic, seeing use in the Great Scourge of Malachor.[19] They were also used in the Battles of Rashfond and the Peacekeeping of Parliock,[1] The proto-saber was an ancient type of prototype lightsaber.[20]

During the history of the Jedi Order, the lightsaber was considered to be the Jedi's only true ally in battle.[1] As Master Obi-Wan Kenobi once declared to his Padawan Anakin Skywalker in the days of the late Republic, the lightsaber was a Jedi's life.[21] Jedi saw the lightsaber as a symbol of the care that they would wield using their gifts given by the Force, and also served as a message to their opponents: mastering the lightsaber required great skill and training. The choice of the saber was also the symbol of their role and duty as protectors, not destroyers, and the fact that the Jedi did not seek power and only sought to stand tall against darkness.[22] Still, Jedi knew they would need to be more than their lightsabers.[23]

When Padawan Enya Keen lost her lightsaber during a mission to Dalna, her master, Char-Ryl-Roy, reminded her that she would need to act as a Jedi without the weapon. While finding a kyber crystal was still a sacred part of a Jedi's duty and Keen felt like losing her lightsaber would feel like losing part of herself, she willingly gave away the crystal if it meant finding more about the Path of the Open Hand and its plans.[23] Lightsabers took on a more prominent role in galactic affairs as the Clone Wars came to pass. Jedi, previously peacekeepers, became Jedi Generals of the Grand Army of the Republic, and thus began using their lightsabers more often than they had in their role of peacekeeping.[24]

For the majority of the Empire's reign, the only lightsabers that were prominently used were those of Darth Vader and the Inquisitors who served him.[19] All the same, there were still lightsabers used by Jedi survivors and those they trained, like Obi-Wan Kenobi, Luke Skywalker,[2] Ahsoka Tano, Kanan Jarrus, and Ezra Bridger.[19] Vader wielded a dual-phase lightsaber, a design of an older, more dangerous generation.[26] Domina Tagge of the Tagge Corporation tried to recreate the lightsaber through the Tagge protoblade.[27]

After the Empire was defeated, Luke began training a new generation of Jedi.[15] Tano adopted the Mandalorian Sabine Wren as her Padawan, with Wren taking on Bridger's lightsaber as her own.[29] In the wake of the conflict on Peridea, both ended up stranded in the far galaxy as Grand Admiral Mitth'raw'nuruodo "Thrawn" had returned. Bridger, with a new lightsaber in his possession, did manage to return to the galaxy as well, however.[30]

Skywalker's new generation of Jedi were killed in the destruction of his Jedi temple, once again leading to a time where the only prominent lightsaber user was a dark sider, Kylo Ren. That all changed when a scavenger, Rey, discovered the Skywalker lightsaber[15] and ultimately came to train under Luke Skywalker and his twin sister Leia Organa to combat Kylo Ren and the First Order during a war against the Imperial successors.[31] After the war, Rey ritually buried her masters' lightsabers at the Lars Homestead on Luke's home planet, Tatooine, to end the Skywalker family's suffering. She ignited her newly crafted lightsaber to show her complete journey as a Jedi, and, to honor the Skywalkers' legacy, she took the Skywalker name as her surname after receiving the blessing from the Force spirits of her masters when she was asked by a local.[32]

A lightsaber drew power from an appropriately-sized power cell.[34] Parts that would work to make a lightsaber include modulation circuits and an energy gate. Ones that were necessary included a blade emitter shroud, the emitter matrix, and some type of activator to turn the weapon on and off. Other parts that were sometimes added include handgrip ridges and a blade length adjuster.[34][12] Some lightsabers also featured a non-lethal low-power setting used for training.[35] Single-bladed lightsabers usually had a belt ring so they could be hung from a belt hook, or a wheel-shaped attachment that slotted into a matching belt clip on the owner's belt when not in use.[36][5][37][38][34]
