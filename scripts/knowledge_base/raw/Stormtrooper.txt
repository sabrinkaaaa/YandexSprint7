# Stormtrooper

Stormtroopers (STs)—also known as Imperial stormtroopers and derogatorally referred to as "bucketheads"—were the elite shock troops of the Galactic Empire, and were part of the Stormtrooper Corps, an independent military branch operating under the Imperial Army. These elite, obedient and zealous soldiers wore armor consisting of white plastoid plates over a black body glove, and their standard issue weapon was the E-11 medium blaster rifle. In addition to the standard variant trooper, various specialized units such as scout troopers and snowtroopers comprised the ranks of the corps. Alongside Imperial-class Star Destroyers and TIE fighters, stormtroopers served as reminders of the absolute power of the Empire. In addition, stormtroopers would serve with the regular infantry to enforce oppressive rule over the galaxy.

Taking their name from the "storm" of galactic history, clone troopers served as the first generation of stormtroopers, and were gradually replaced by Imperial recruits known as TK stormtroopers. Clone troopers were composed of the clones who formed the backbone of the Grand Army of the Republic from its inception at the end of the Clone Wars when the Sith Lord Darth Sidious declared the Galactic Republic at an end and himself Galactic Emperor. Into the early years of the Imperial Era, the cloning operation on Kamino was shut down as the Empire turned to conscription and voluntary recruitment in order to fill the stormtrooper ranks. The remaining clones were gradually retired from service due to their rapid aging, their legacy inherited by natural-born humans who were also trained to render total allegiance to the Emperor and his New Order.

Stormtroopers were spread throughout galaxy, from the galactic capital of Coruscant in the Core Worlds, to major installations and vital worlds, enforcing widespread terror and mass oppression. These infantry fought many battles against the forces of the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War, including the Battle of Scarif, the Battle of Hoth, and the Battle of Endor. Shortly before the Battle of Yavin, Princess Leia Organa was captured by stormtroopers who served under the Emperor's lieutenant, Darth Vader. However, Organa was rescued by Luke Skywalker and Han Solo who, disguised as stormtroopers, infiltrated the first Death Star. The Emperor stationed a legion of stormtroopers on Endor to protect the shield generator of the second Death Star, although they were defeated by the Alliance's Ewok allies.

With the deaths of Emperor Palpatine and Lord Vader, Counselor to the Empire Gallius Rax took control of the Empire, which rallied to his homeworld of Jakku to make a final stand against the New Republic during the Battle of Jakku, however the Empire collapsed, with its replacement of the New Republic consequently demobilizing stormtrooper forces.

Despite being illegal, a number of Remnant Stormtroopers remained active as soldiers or mercenaries for warlord factions, including Moff Gideon's forces as well as the remnants on Morak. By the last days of the New Republic Era, a new generation of stormtroopers emerged from the Unknown Regions as standard soldiers of the First Order.

At the dawn of the Galactic Empire, the first generation of stormtroopers consisted of cloned soldiers who served the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars.[4] Under the leadership of the Jedi Knights, clone troopers fought the droid armies of the Confederacy of Independent Systems across the galaxy. Though they were loyal to the Jedi as well as the Republic, the clones were secretly programmed to obey Order 66,[20] a military directive authorizing the complete liquidation of the Jedi Order.[21]

With the exception of a handful of survivors,[22] including Jedi Generals Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi, most of the Jedi were killed by their own troops at the command of Darth Sidious, the Sith Lord who orchestrated the Clone Wars and controlled the Galactic Senate through his secret identity of Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine.[23] With the Empire claiming the galaxy was brought from chaos to order during to its rule, one account of the origins of the name "stormtrooper" was that it came from the troopers emerging from the "storm" of galactic history.[19] Another origin came from the final days of the Republic Era: with clone shock troopers enforcing law on the Republic capital of Coruscant[24] and taking the role once held by the Senate Guard,[25] onlookers began to refer to the soldiers as "stormtroopers."[24]

Renamed "stormtroopers" and assigned their new role by Emperor Palpatine himself,[27] the clone troopers enforced his reign during the early years of the Imperial Era[4] No longer beholden to the authority of Jedi officers[2] who exercised restraint in warfare,[28][29] the clones utilized brutal tactics under the leadership of Imperial officers and Governors,[2] suppressing dissent and imposing the New Order over the known galaxy as the first generation of Imperial stormtroopers.[4] Immediately, the Empire moved to remove sedition within its legislative branch, as clones were deployed to carry out the Senatorial arrests, rounding up a total of sixty-three senators who were subsequently claimed to be Jedi sympathizers.[30]

The end of the Clone Wars, however, fulfilled the sole purpose behind the creation of clone troopers.[22] Although Palpatine supported the Kaminoan government’s clone trooper program during his final years as Supreme Chancellor, his priorities changed from the expensive cloning production after aponting himself Galactic Emperor. The Prime Minister of Kamino, Lama Su, maintained that the clone troopers possessed unrivaled combat skills and discipline. In addition, Lama Su believed that his clones were critical to the security of the fledgling Empire. Despite this, Governor and Admiral Wilhuff Tarkin was confident the Empire would be better served by a force of recruits, which he saw as a cost-effective way to enforce order in the galaxy.[26] In addition, the clones' accelerated aging process,[22] limited shelf-life,[31] and original purpose as soldiers to the Republic[32] were further incentives for the Empire to decommission its clone units in favor of natural-born humans.[22]

Although Governor Tarkin supported conscription[26] and recruitment over cloning,[33] clone troopers were initially retained by the Imperial Army that replaced the Grand Army of the Republic,[22] but rumors spread throughout the ranks that the cloning facilities on Kamino had been shut down.[34]
