# Star Destroyer

A Star Destroyer was a dagger-shaped type of capital ship that were used by the Galactic Republic, the Galactic Empire, the First Order, and the Sith Eternal. Notable examples of Star Destroyers include the Imperial-class Star Destroyer and its predecessor, the Venator-class Star Destroyer.[2]

According to Everi Chalis, Star Destroyers were the most resource-intensive ships the galaxy had ever seen, and only Kuat possessed shipyards that were capable of supporting and maintaining more than a handful at a time.[4]

The Executor-class Star Dreadnought,[5] also known as the Super-class Star Destroyer,[6] was the largest model of Star Destroyer ever built by the Galactic Empire.[5] It was usually referred to as a Super Star Destroyer,[7] and consisted of the sub-models Executor I-class[8] and Executor II-class.[9] 19,000 meters long, it was used as a command ship and had over 5,000 turbolasers and ion cannons.[10]

The Mega-class Star Dreadnought, also referred to as the Mega-class Star Destroyer, was the capital of the First Order and its Supreme Leader. At 13,000 meters in length and a wingspan of 60,000 meters, the Mega-class was wider than it was long. The sole example of the model, the Supremacy, was used by Supreme Leader Snoke and the First Order Navy to attack the Resistance.[11]

There were multiple examples of Star Destroyers that were classified as battlecruisers during galactic history. The Maelstrom-class battle cruiser, used by the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars, was primarily mothballed by the Galactic Empire, and at least one example, the Simoom, was used by the Alliance to Restore the Republic. The Maelstrom-class was considered to be a proto-Star Destroyer, and was armed with assault concussion missile launchers, heavy cannons, and other weaponry. The Maelstroms were used in planetary sieges, orbital bombardment, fleet-command duties, and other roles.[12]

The Secutor-class Star Destroyer, also identified as the Secutor-class battlecarrier, was another example of a battlecruiser in the Star Destroyer design family. A little more than 2 kilometers in length, the Secutor was used as a carrier and command ship by the Galactic Empire. It was possibly the largest starfighter dedicated vessel in the Imperial Navy.[13] The Empire's successor state, the First Order, widely deployed the Resurgent-class Star Destroyer (alternatively designated as the Resurgent-class Battlecruiser[14]) during the Cold War[15] and the First Order-Resistance War.[16] The Resurgent was a 2,915 meter-long warship that featured advanced weaponry and systems.[17]

According to the Anaxes War College System, the Sith Eternal's Xyston-class Star Destroyer, at 2,406 meters, was a battlecruiser.[18] The Xyston was a model of Star Destroyer that was based on an upscaled Imperial I-class design. The Xyston-class possessed heavy weaponry, including the axial superlaser cannon which had the capability of destroying entire planets.[19]

The Republic's Acclamator-class assault ship was a 752 meter-long[10] cruiser that was considered to be a proto-Star Destroyer.[12] Its sub-variants were the Acclamator I-class[20] and the Acclamator II-class.[21] It was used as a carrier and transport for troops and vehicles to a planet's surface. The Venator-class Star Destroyer, a class of cruiser[22] 1,137 meters in length[23], was also referred to as the Republic Attack Cruiser[24] or Jedi cruiser[2] and was considered a proto-Star Destroyer.[12] It consisted of two sub-variants, the Venator I-class[25] and the Venator II-class,[26] and was extensively used by the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars and by the early Galactic Empire.[27]

The successor of the Venator-class,[2] the 1,600 meter-long[28] Imperial-class Star Destroyer,[2] was also classified as a cruiser.[29] The Imperial-class consisted of the sub-variants Imperial I-class, Imperial II-class, and the Interdictor-class.[28] The Imperial-class became symbols of the Empire's New Order.[2] The Interdictor-class heavy cruiser was a class of heavy cruiser[13] that was also part of the Star Destroyer family of ships used by the Empire.[30] It was 1,129 meters long and was equipped with four gravity well projectors to serve in its capacity as an Interdictor vessel.[10] The Onager-class Star Destroyer was also classified as a cruiser class, and was equipped with a superweapon that could destroy targets on the surface of a planet or entire fleets.[13]

Another cruiser, in accordance with the Anaxes War College System, the Gladiator-class Star Destroyer was the smallest Star Destroyer in the Empire's arsenal at 600 meters in length.[31] Despite its size, it was heavily armed and was deployed as a patrol ship and escort.[13] It could serve in the capacity of a flagship for a small task force[32] or battle group.[33] The Gladiator I was a sub-variant of the ship.[32]
