# Death Star

A Death Star was a gargantuan space station armed with a planet-destroying superlaser powered by kyber crystals.

The DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station,[5] also known as the DS-1 Orbital Battle Station,[10] was a superweapon that was originally designed by the Geonosians during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. The project was later taken over by the Galactic Empire;[2] however, the plans for the battle station were stolen from Scarif by the Rebel Alliance,[9] which led to the weapon's destruction at the Battle of Yavin, but not before it unleashed its planet-destroying cannon on the Imperial security complex on Scarif,[9] Jedha City on Jedha,[2] and annihilated the entire planet of Alderaan.[7]

The name "Death Star" was coined by the scientists who found themselves working on the project, such as Galen Walton Erso.[9] The name was adopted by the Empire at large, with Major Lio Partagaz of the Imperial Security Bureau considering it "a prescient turn of phrase."[11]

After the destruction of the first Death Star, the DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station was the second and final Death Star constructed by the Galactic Empire and was designed to be more powerful than the original. During the Battle of Endor, the Death Star II's energy shield was destroyed and the Rebels used the unfinished superstructure of the battle station against it, destroying the weapon as they had its predecessor.[6]

The idea of the Death Stars and empowering players to be able to tell stories with similar engines of death and levels of sci-fi gravitas and drama was an inspiration for the now-massive novel and wargame franchise Warhammer 40,000 as noted at the start of the first rule book for the first edition.[12]

Mimas, the smallest and the innermost of seven major moons orbiting the planet Saturn, is notable for a single enormous impact crater called Herschel. The appearance of Mimas and Herschel in pictures taken during the space probe Voyager I's 1980 flyby of the Saturn system showed a similarity to the first Death Star, with Herschel appearing as the superlaser disc, as remarked in the scientific press.[13] This resemblance became one of Mimas's most notable characteristics in astronomy and popular culture.[14]

During the Cassini orbiter's visit to the Saturn system in 2004, the resemblance was noted again in the official press releases[15] and by the scientific press.[16] However, Cassini's more recent images of Mimas do not all resemble a Death Star orbiting Saturn, as the moon is more egg-shaped then the battlestation.[17]

In late 2012, a petition was submitted to the White House website urging that the United States government build a real Death Star as a economic stimulus and a means to ensure people got back to work again, and wanted its completion by 2016 at the earliest. The petition gained more then 25,000 signatures, ensuring that an official response be supplied. In early 2013, the proposal was rejected (in a tongue-and-cheek manner), citing that the overall cost of the Death Star's construction would amount to a cost exceeding $852 quadrillion, and would take 833,000 years before it could even be ready for construction due to the rate of steel production. Another reason for the rejection was also because the Government "did not support blowing up planets."[18] As such, the Star Wars Blog, in response to it, created a light-hearted, in universe reply from the Galactic Empire's Public Relations department were the Empire, with official statements from Admiral Conan Antonio Motti and Governor Wilhuff Tarkin, shrugged off the criticisms by the planet Earth's leaders regarding the design of the battlestation. In addition, in the same source, it also denounced the planet for grossly overestimating the cost of designing the Death Star, as well as commenting the overall lack of production methods of the planet in comparison of the Galactic Empire, even implying that the planet's leaders were cowardly in their decision.[19]
