# Speeder bike

Speeder bikes, also known as jumpspeeders, were open-air repulsorlift vehicles that emphasized speed and maneuverability over stability. A particularly powerful speeder bike is called a swoop.

The Jedi used the Undicur-class jumpspeeder, which proved popular with civilians.[2] Another civilian speeder bike was the Joben T-85 speeder bike, used by the Jedi Kanan Jarrus.[3]

The Clone Wars saw the development of the CK-6 swoop bikes for use in cold climates,[4] as well as combat speeders designed for the Separatist warlord General Grievous.[5] Hondo Ohnaka's gang rode Starhawk speeder bikes.[6]

The Imperial speeder bike lineage could be traced to the BARC speeders used during the Clone Wars.[7] Imperial forces used the 614-AvA speeder bike until it was phased out by the 74-Z.[8]

Speeder bikes were sometimes a target for theft. Merei Spanjaf, a teenage girl living on Lothal, owned a jumpspeeder that could fit into a speeder van. She normally wore a helmet and goggles when riding it.[9]

On At Attin during the New Republic Era, Fern and KB owned a modified two-being hoverbike, while Wim and Neel owned one-being hoverbikes.

Jace Rucklin had two speeder bikes, one orange and one blue when he befriend Kazuda Xiono. Unknown to Xiono, his blue bike was purposely sabotage.[10] The Warbird gang also use the same speeder bike model, during their raid on the Colossus[11] and when they kidnapped Torra Doza.[12] On Varkana, Synara San stole the same speeder model when she chase after Ax Tagrin. Norath Kev and Xiono escape on San's speeder bike.[13]

The Undicur-class jumpspeeder, 614-AvA speeder bike, and Starhawk speeder bike were all based on a vehicle concept by Joe Johnston[14] for Return of the Jedi.

Rucklin's speederbikes in Fuel for the Fire were also made from early concept arts of Return of the Jedi.[15]
