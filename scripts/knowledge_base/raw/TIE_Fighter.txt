# TIE/ln space superiority starfighter

The TIE/ln space superiority starfighter, also called the TIE/ln or simply the TIE fighter, was the signature starfighter of the Galactic Empire and symbol of its space superiority. Instantly recognizable from the roar of its engines as well as its unique design, the TIE/ln exuded Imperial power and prestige across the galaxy, seeing use throughout the Empire's reign. They were nicknamed Evil-Eyes[12] or Eye-balls[35] by members of the New Republic.[12]

The TIE/ln starfighter was a small, short-range fighter developed, manufactured, and mass produced by Sienar Fleet Systems (SFS). Developed by SFS company head Raith Sienar,[1] the basis for the TIE fighter could be traced back to Kuat Systems Engineering's Alpha-3 Nimbus starfighter, along with several other outmoded models from the Old Republic.[4] Like their predecessors, TIE's employed two vertical wings similar in appearance to V-wing starfighters; however, the Eta-2 Actis-class light interceptor bore even more similarities with its central cockpit pod, twin ion engines, and common weapons technology.[3] Its official production name was the Twin Ion Engine "line edition" space superiority starfighter.[4]

The fighter's name is derived from its propulsion system, which was specifically designed to create a distinct noise so as to inspire fear in those who opposed the Empire.[6] These were originally two P-s3 ion engines, which would be replaced by twin P-s4 ion engines by approximately 14 BBY.[9] These engines could expel charged particles along almost any vector, providing the TIE fighter with incredible maneuverability, and their lack of moving parts or high-temperature components made them easier to maintain: Imperial records indicated less than five percent of all TIE fighters lost were as a result of field attrition.[6] Fuel for the engines consisted of a radioactive gas kept in pressurized fuel tankage located on the underside of the cockpit.[4][6][37]

A TIE fighter's twin ion engines, combined with W-401 maneuvering jets, provided thrust and boosters capable of quickly adjusting the ship's direction. The TIE/ln featured vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) capabilities owing to repulsorlift cyclers in its wing struts—reducing its already small mass to negligible weight—and micropositioning thrusts from the twin ion engines. Furthermore, the lack of a hyperdrive and resultant navigational systems alongside extended life support and fuel combined to cut down the TIE's total mass.[4][6]

In order to reduce cost, mass and energy consumption while improving maneuverability, the TIE fighter lacked deflector shields. It was armored with quadanium steel plating which was proof against hand-held blasters[6] (except in exposed areas such as the stabilizers[38]) but could be penetrated by direct hits from military-grade laser cannons, heavy blaster cannons, and micrometeor impacts. However the cockpit's spherical shape meant that glancing blows would be deflected away.[6] TIE fighters were equipped with sensor jamming capabilities and could be retrofitted with additional electronic countermeasures.[37][39][40]

The fighter's black "wings" were in fact an array of twelve solar collectors, framed by rigid quadanium steel foil braces, that featured a micro-crenulated solar absorption surface.[4][6] From there, power would be pooled to the fighter's solar energy collection hub[4] and then to its twin ion engines. Originally the wings also powered the fighter's armaments, but this was found to quickly drain the fighter of energy and negatively affected its maneuverability. These early fighters were later retrofitted with a dedicated generator to power the lasers, a feature that became standard on all TIE fighters.[6] These wings also served as stabilizers.[41]

The wings were sturdy enough to double as landing gear, further reducing overall mass, however, TIE fighters were designed to be deployed and retrieved using special cycling racks. Standard on Star Destroyers and other Imperial facilities, each rack system had a maximum capacity of 72 fighters. Beyond allowing pilots and technicians to access the craft more easily, the system was also equipped with small tractor beam projectors to assist with landing operations.[6][37]

One drawback to the wing design was that it did obscure the pilot's field of vision, yet Imperial authorities considered this an acceptable motivation for pilots to concentrate on the targets in front of them.[6] Due to its importance as a stabilizer, if part of the wing were to be removed to increase sight it would cost the fighter stability, which would then hamper the ship's ability to engage in dog fights.[41] The wings did provide some measure of additional protection for the cockpit, and the fighter's sensor array compensated for the blind spots by augmenting and expanding the pilot's visual range.[6]

The TIE/ln was first and foremost designed for space combat, and while capable of operating in a planetary atmosphere it was at a distinct disadvantage versus other starfighters like the X-wing. The hexagonal wings made it harder to steer and more vulnerable to crosswinds. If it attempted to reverse its thrust too hard in order to decelerate, the fighter also risked causing severe structural damage to the wing spars and support pylons.[6] However, depending on the circumstances the TIE fighter could still give a good account for itself in atmospheric combat. When operating down in tight urban confines and an oxygen-rich atmosphere for example, a TIE fighter was equal to an X-wing in speed and maneuverability.[40] At higher altitudes it could also successfully engage in dogfights with X-wings at supersonic speeds.[42]

The TIE fighter's primary armament was a pair of L-s1 low-temperature laser cannons capable of destroying a Taylander shuttle in a single shot,[43][44] although by the time of the Battle of Endor these had been replaced with L-s7.2 laser cannons. The green blaster bolt these weapons fired was the result of the more expensive blaster gas used by the Empire and aided pilots in identifying their shots. Mated to the cannons was an advanced T-s8 targeting computer—later replaced by the T-s9a model—which was considered superior to the targeting computers on Rebel fighters.[6] As all combat craft were equipped with some form of sensor jammer equipment, the targeting computer cut down on the amount of time needed to obtain a "target lock," although for best performance they required constant readjustment by the pilot.[37] While TIE fighters lacked any secondary weaponry as standard, they could be retrofitted to carry additional armaments such as missiles or replace their normal laser cannons with other models or ion cannons.[39]
