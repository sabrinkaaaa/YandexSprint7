# Luke Skywalker

Luke Skywalker, a Force-sensitive human male, was a legendary Jedi Master who fought in the Galactic Civil War during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Along with his companions, Princess Leia Organa and General Han Solo, Skywalker served as a revolutionary on the side of the Alliance to Restore the Republic—an organization committed to the downfall of the Galactic Empire and the restoration of democracy. Following the war, Skywalker became a living legend, and was remembered as one of the greatest Jedi in galactic history.

The son of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and Senator Padmé Amidala, Luke Skywalker was born along with his twin sister, Leia, in 19 BBY. As a result of Amidala's death and Anakin's fall to the dark side of the Force, the Skywalker children were separated and sent into hiding, with Leia adopted by the royal family of Alderaan while Luke was raised by his relatives on Tatooine. Longing for a life of adventure and purpose, Skywalker joined the Rebellion and began learning the ways of the Force under the guidance of Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, whose first apprentice was Luke's own father. During the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, Skywalker saved the Alliance from annihilation by destroying the Empire's planet-killing superweapon, the Death Star. He continued his training in the years that followed, determined to become a Jedi Knight like his father before him, and found a new mentor in Grand Master Yoda. After his master's death, Skywalker participated in the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, during which he confronted the Sith Lord Darth Vader, whom he learned was in fact his father, Anakin Skywalker. With Luke's help, Anakin returned to the light side of the Force by killing the Emperor and Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious at the cost of his own life, fulfilling his destiny as the Chosen One. Following the Battle of Endor, Skywalker trained his sister as a first Jedi apprentice on Ajan Kloss, but Leia ended her training after the birth of her son and seeing his death as a result of finishing her knighthood.

With the Sith's destruction and the subsequent capitulation of the Empire, Skywalker traveled across the galaxy during New Republic Era, searching for knowledge that would aid him in rebuilding the Jedi Order. In 9 ABY, Skywalker rescued Grogu, a Mandalorian Force-sensitive child that belonged to the same species as Yoda, from Moff Gideon's forces, and after temporarily taking the child as an apprentice on Ossus. During the training, Skywalker was visited by Anakin's former padawan, Ahsoka Tano, where they discussed Grogu and how Skywalker sensed that the child's heart was not in relearning the Jedi path. After Grogu's caregiver, Din Djarin, visited the planet bearing a gift for Grogu, Skywalker offered him with a choice, accept the gift and return to the Mandalorian, or take Yoda's lightsaber and continue with his Jedi training. Grogu chose to return to Djarin, while Skywalker bid Tano farewell as she departed for ways unknown.

Skywalker later took his sister's son, Ben Solo, by 15 ABY who inherited the bloodline in the Force and had the potential for limitless power, as an apprentice. Both traveled to Elphrona to study lost Jedi lore, where the trio encountered the Knights of Ren, while Solo began to be groomed by Snoke, a humanoid being powerful in the Force. In 21 ABY, Skywalker started feeling an increasing darkness in the Force and having dark visions that frequently came to him in meditation and undertook a quest to find the hidden world of Exegol. Skywalker journeyed to Tython where upon meditating, he saw a vision of Exegol and faced nine wraiths when the force ghost of Anakin Skywalker appeared next to him. Following this, Skywalker was able to defeat Kiza and the spirit of Exim Panshard but was ultimately unable to locate Exegol after failing to track down an assassin called Ochi.

In 28 ABY, Skywalker, glimpsing the darkness in Solo, briefly contemplated killing him, causing Solo to fall to the dark side. The destruction of his temple and the deaths of all his students convinced a haunted and regretful Skywalker that the time had come for the Jedi to end. Skywalker therefore sought exile on the distant world of Ahch-To, having elected to live out his remaining days as a hermit despite the galaxy's pleas for help during the rise of the First Order. His solitude was interrupted in 34 ABY, shortly after the fall of the New Republic, resulting in a chain of events that led Skywalker to play one last, momentous role in the conflict between light and darkness. Although he passed away into the Force, his legend would spread throughout the galaxy, rekindling a spark of hope in the enemies of the First Order. Before his death, Skywalker declared that the Jedi Order would not die with him, having trained a final apprentice: the Jakku scavenger known as Rey.

A year later, Skywalker's spirit communed with Rey during the final days of the war. The Jedi apprentice had exiled herself to Ahch-To, following in Skywalker's example. However, he urged Rey to confront her grandfather, the resurrected Darth Sidious. Believing he had been wrong, Skywalker told Rey that a Jedi's destiny was to confront fear. Following the Emperor's destruction, the spirits of Skywalker and his sister watched over Rey as she buried their lightsabers in Skywalker's childhood home on Tatooine and adopted the Skywalker name as her own, honoring their legacy and recognizing herself as a member of her chosen family.

During the Clone Wars, Jedi Master Yoda set out on a journey to discover the secrets of immortality. His journey took him to Moraband, the ancient Sith homeworld, where he faced visions of the future. At the end of his journey, the Force Priestess, Serenity, who guided his journey told him that there was another Skywalker, and Yoda heard his voice from the future say so as well.[22] These events alluded to the birth and destiny of Luke Skywalker, as well as his twin sister Leia.[12]

Luke Skywalker was born in 19 BBY[3] on the asteroid field of Polis Massa[13] two days after the proclamation of the Galactic Empire.[2] He[1] and his twin sister, Leia, who was born minutes after him, were the children of Galactic Republic Senator Padmé Amidala, who died shortly after the births, and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, who had recently fallen to the dark side of the Force. To protect the children from the Empire and their father, the now-Sith Lord Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kenobi personally sent the infant Luke to be raised by Anakin's stepbrother, Owen Lars and his wife, Beru on the planet Tatooine, while Senator Bail Organa agreed to adopt Leia together with his wife, the queen of Alderaan.[13] Kenobi boarded the late General Grievous's starfighter, the Soulless One, once more flew to the planet Nar Shaddaa and sold it there to transport Luke Skywalker to Tatooine.[23]

Luke Skywalker spent his youth on the Lars' moisture farm, where his uncle unsuccessfully tried to discourage his adventurous tendencies, telling him that his father had been "a navigator on a spice freighter" during the Clone Wars.[1] His aunt, Beru, would read him storybooks; one day, when his uncle had business in Mos Eisley, she took Skywalker to Anchorhead to use the HoloNet connections there and show him images of forests, rivers, and oceans.[6]

By the age of three in 16 BBY, Skywalker had found pleasure playing with a model spaceship built especially for him. He did not know that Kenobi had actually built it and that Kenobi had been leaving several of them at his grandmother, Shmi's sandblasted tombstone for his aunt to find. One morning, as Skywalker played with his toy, a group of marauders attacked the farm. Obi-Wan Kenobi, who had been watching him from afar, sprang into action, cutting down several Gamorreans before coming to the realization that he was badly outnumbered. Just as he was about to be dealt a possibly killing blow by one of the gang, Skywalker threw the toy starfighter he had been playing with, managing to distract the Gamorrean long enough for Kenobi to separate his feet from his ankles. The battle then raged further, slowly turning in the favor of the defenders which included Owen Lars, who managed to gun down several of the invaders with a blaster. Luke cried out after noticing that one of the marauders, a Devaronian, had snuck up behind Lars, ready to knock him out. Kenobi then threw his lightsaber cutting the last marauder in half. As Skywalker cheered, Lars threw a punch which knocked Kenobi to the ground. Lars then ushered Skywalker back before chastising Kenobi for his involvement, pointing out the fact that Skywalker's brief show of bravery had potential ramifications for the boy's future.[24]
